This example demonstrates an unexpected behavior of the nullish coalescing operator (??) in TypeScript.  The nullish coalescing operator only checks for null and undefined values.  Other falsy values, such as 0, empty strings, or false, are treated differently. This can lead to unexpected results when handling optional parameters or values that may be falsy but not null or undefined. The solution shows how to address this by using a different approach if handling all falsy values is required.
